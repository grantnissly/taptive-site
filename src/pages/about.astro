              Taptive is a growth agency built specifically for the Bitcoin economy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Founded by Grant Nissly, Taptive helps Bitcoin-native companies grow through
              narrative-first strategy. In a space defined by technical innovation and
              ideological commitment, the companies that win are the ones who can tell
              their story clearly and reach the right people.
            </p>

            <p>
              We've worked with some of the most ambitious projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem,
              from DeFi protocols to foundations to community-driven initiatives. Our approach
              combines strategic business development, go-to-market planning, and community
              building—all tailored to how the Bitcoin economy actually works.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Bitcoin economy is different. It has its own culture, its own distribution
              channels, and its own way of building trust. Generic growth playbooks don't work
              here. That's why Taptive exists—to help great projects find their path to growth
              in this unique ecosystem.

            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              In the Bitcoin economy, story precedes adoption. Before people use your product,
              they need to believe in what you're building and why. We help companies craft
              and communicate that narrative.

            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Bitcoin has its own culture and community dynamics. Growth strategies that work
              elsewhere often fail here. We understand how the Bitcoin ecosystem actually
              operates and build strategies that fit.

              The Bitcoin space is built on trust and relationships. We focus on building
              genuine connections that create long-term value, not short-term metrics.
